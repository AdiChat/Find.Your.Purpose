# Contributing guidelines

It is a noble experience to contribute to this mission of documenting some of the noble products that are making our planet :earth_americas: a better place to live in each day.

* ### Add a product to an existing purpose

In order to do so, _try to_ adhere to the following format:

* ### Add a new purpose 

In order to add a new purpose, _try to_ adhere to the format:

> Helping people to ...

Add the new purpose to the end and it should contain at least one product.

* No other rules unless you are happy. :smile:
